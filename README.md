# hello-world
I need help with mapping data about cities and patterns of interaction. Also energy consumption or something for that matter.

Hellooo :)
I´ve downloaded the Depth-map software but i dont know how to use it :/

I´ve seen maps of analisys about city uses and it looks reaaaalllyyyy interesting. Im hoping to learn how to use this.



If anyone can help me, it´ll be highlly appreciated :)
